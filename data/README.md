    * We evaluate our proposed semi-supervised method on the dataset of 2018 Atrial Segmentation Challenge for left atrium segmentation in 3D gadolinium-enhanced MR image scans (GE-MRIs). The dataset consists of 100 scans with segmentation masks. We select 80 samples for training and 20 for testing and use the same data preprocessing methods for a fair comparison.
    * The data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/yulequan/UA-MT/tree/master/data).
